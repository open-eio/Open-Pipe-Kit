## About
The Open Pipe Kit (OPK) is the missing plumbing between sensors and databases that will empower thousands of data journalists and civic hackers to collect data without needing a programmer's assistance or being locked into one data platform from a proprietary turn-key solution. 

___Until the OPK reaches 1.0, it is intended for developers only. See the [OPK Roadmap to 1.0](https://github.com/open-eio/Open-Pipe-Kit/issues/1).___
